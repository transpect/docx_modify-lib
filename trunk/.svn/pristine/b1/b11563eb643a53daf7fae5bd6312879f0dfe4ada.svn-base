# docx_modify-lib

A library to manipulate docx files by applying an XSLT transformation to its single-root tree (all the zip archiveâ€™s XML files 
under a single root element). The library then takes care of re-serialization and zipping of the transformed content. 
Needs a front-end project that pulls in the required libraries, an XML catalog, etc.
